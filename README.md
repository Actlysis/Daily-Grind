# Solidity Jottings  

I use [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) to keep my daily jottings.  
Kindly download Joplin to view my documents in their best format.  

📓 **What’s inside?**  
- Raw notes from my Solidity journey  
- Both **wins and losses** — and how I worked through them  
- Straight from my personal learning process, not polished tutorials  

💡 **Why this repo?**  
This is a living log of my grind. I document everything I understood, struggled with, and overcame — step by step.  

⚠️ **Note:** These files are not intended for reading like a book.  
They exist as **proof of consistency and visibility** for my journey.
