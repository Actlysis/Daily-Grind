# Solidity Jottings

I use [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) to keep my daily jottings.  
Everything here is straight from my notes — before I push, I run it through ChatGPT to check for mistakes.  
If I mess something up, I learn from it and update the notes right away.  

If you find this repo useful, a ⭐ would mean a lot!
